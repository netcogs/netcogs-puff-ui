# Netcogs UI Theme

A Red White Smooth UI Theme for atom by Netcogs.

Install from the command line:
$ apm install netcogs-redwhite-light-ui


Features:
- Clean Interface Design
- Clean Tree View
- Smooth & Enhanced Settings Panel
- More Focus On Elements
- Animated Tabs
- Customized Scroll Bars


This is our first theme for the atom editor, this is forked from atom-light-ui.
we will keep improving this theme & surely bring more flavors & better versions of it.

Looks great when used with [Netcogs RW Dark](https://github.com/netcogs/netcogs-rw-drk-syntax) syntax theme.

All the style codes are in 'custom-styles.less', some other files are disabled.
Enabling them will cause this theme to crash. They are been left just for reference purpose.
