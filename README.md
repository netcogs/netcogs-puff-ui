# Netcogs UI Theme

Puff Smooth UI Theme for atom by Netcogs.

Features:
- Clean Interface Design
- Custom Tree View
- Enhanced Settings Panel
- Resized Workspace Icons
- Smooth Workspace Elements
- Animated Tabs
- Customized Scroll Bars


Looks great when used with [Netcogs Puff](https://github.com/netcogs/netcogs-puff-syntax) syntax theme.

All the style codes are in "custom-styles.less" for convenient style changes, some other files are disabled in "index.less" file.
Enabling them will cause this theme to misbehave. They're been left just for reference purpose only.
